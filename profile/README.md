# 🚀 Welcome to Orbit

**orbitrs** is the home of **Orbit** — a next-generation, Rust-first UI framework that unifies web, native, and embedded application development through a single component model.

> **Build once, deploy everywhere** with the performance, safety, and elegance of Rust.

---

## 🔭 What Makes Orbit Different

Orbit brings several unique innovations to Rust UI development:

- **`.orbit` Component Format**: Combine declarative markup, styling, and Rust logic in a unified file format
- **Hybrid Rendering Architecture**: Leverage both Skia (for optimized 2D UI) and WGPU (for advanced 3D capabilities)
- **Cross-Platform by Design**: Target browsers (WASM), desktop apps, and embedded systems from the same codebase
- **Developer-First Experience**: Enjoy hot reloading, powerful CLI tools, and comprehensive static analysis
